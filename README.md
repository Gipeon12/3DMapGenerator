# 3DMapGenerator

This 3D Map Generator includes a user interface for parameterizing and generating a random 3D environment composed of a spatial distribution of geometric solids and/or topographic surfaces created from Perlin noise. This 3D map is intended to be used in a context of autonomous exploration by a cohort of robots.

All required files should be found in the ProjectFiles folder. 

### Note: 

In order to get the export feature working, one needs to import packages pycollada, NetworkX, trimesh and scipy.
